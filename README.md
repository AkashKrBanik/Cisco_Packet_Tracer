# Networking Concepts using Cisco Packet Tracer

## 🌐 Topics Explored:
- Network Topologies (Star, Ring, Mesh)
- IP Addressing and Subnetting
- Network Protocols (TCP, UDP, ARP)
- Server Configurations (DNS, HTTP, FTP, DHCP)
- Routing Protocols (OSPF, RIP)
- Network Address Translation (NAT)
- Network Security (Access Control Mechanisms)


## 🔑 Key Learning Outcomes
Learned a lot about how devices communicate, how data moves through networks, and how to set up and troubleshoot network systems. Here are some key things I learned:
- Building Network Topologies: I learned how different devices communicate using various network designs. I worked on creating different network designs, like star, ring, and mesh topologies, and understood how these network architectures impact the network’s performance, reliability and scalability.
- Understanding Network Protocols: I discovered the behind-the-scenes magic of how data travels between computers. By simulating real-world scenarios, I gained insights into critical network protocols like TCP and UDP, understanding the fundamental principles of reliable communication.
- Securing Networks with NAT and Access Control: I explored how organizations protect their computer networks. I learned about implementing access control mechanisms and dynamic Network Address Translation (NAT), thus understanding ways to secure and manage network resources.
- Implementing Routing Protocols: I learned how information finds the best path to travel across different networks. By implementing routing protocols like OSPF and RIP, I gained insights into how networks ensure efficient and intelligent packet transmission – much like how GPS finds the quickest route.
- IP Addressing and Subnetting: I understood how computers get unique addresses, similar to how houses have specific locations in a neighborhood. I dove into IP address allocation, subnetting, and learned how networks dynamically route data across complex infrastructures.
- Network Troubleshooting: The course also gave me opportunities to troubleshoot common issues like connectivity errors, incorrect configurations, and IP conflicts.
- Multi-Server Communication: I designed scenarios with multiple server setups such as DNS, Web, and DHCP Servers interacting with devices, simulating real-world communication setups.

The practical assessments challenged me to create complex network scenarios, from mesh topologies to multi-server communication setups, reinforcing my theoretical knowledge with real-world problem-solving skills. This has not just been about learning technical skills, but understanding the strategic thinking behind network design and management. 
Learned that networking isn't just about technical stuff – it's about connecting people and information efficiently.
